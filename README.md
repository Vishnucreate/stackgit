# AI-Powered Google Search and Summarization Tool

## Overview
This project combines the power of the **Google Search API** and **OpenAI's GPT** to create a streamlined search assistant for developers. The tool extracts the top 10 search results for a given query, summarizes the content, and provides actionable insightsâ€”all in a single step. It's designed to save time and effort, particularly for developers troubleshooting issues or researching topics.

## Features
- **Efficient Search:** Uses the free Google Search API to fetch the top 10 most relevant results.
- **Automated Summarization:** Leverages OpenAI's GPT model to summarize search results into concise, actionable insights.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Provides up-to-date information by sourcing data from Google, GitHub, and Stack Overflow.
- **Cost-Effective:** The Google Search API is free, and the only cost is for AI-powered summarization at just $1 per request.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vishnucreate/stackgit.git
   cd stackgit
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install openai requests
   ```

3. Ensure you have valid API keys for Google Search and OpenAI:
   - [Google Search API Key and CX](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/introduction)
   - [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

## Usage

1. Replace the placeholders in the code with your API keys:
   ```python
   GOOGLE_API_KEY = "your_google_api_key"
   CX = "your_google_cx"
   OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_openai_api_key"
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python your_script_name.py
   ```

3. Enter a query when prompted:
   ```plaintext
   Enter your Python error message or query: AttributeError: module 'openai' has no attribute 'error'
   ```

4. View the extracted search results and the AI-generated summary.



## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: `openai`, `requests`
- Valid API keys for Google Search and OpenAI.

## How It Works
1. **Search Google:** The script sends the query to the Google Search API and fetches the top 10 results.
2. **Extract Data:** Extracts the titles, snippets, and links from the raw JSON response.
3. **Summarize Results:** Uses OpenAI's GPT to summarize the results into a concise, user-friendly format.

## Troubleshooting
- **Issue:** `AttributeError: module 'openai' has no attribute 'ChatCompletion'`  
  **Solution:** Ensure you're using the latest version of the OpenAI library. Update with:
  ```bash
  pip install --upgrade openai
  ```

- **Issue:** `Error with Google Search API: ...`  
  **Solution:** Verify your Google API key and CX configuration in the script.
